## Analysis Steps

During the analysis process of this project, I was required to figure out how I would receive the user input of the month and year they wanted to display on the console. I had to try and take that input data and reflect it to the correct month with day numbers displayed in a table with days of the week. I tried to implement leap year calculations, so that they would not throw off the days of the year.

### Design

I tried to create an array with string and integers to store my data for the days within the month. I had 13 string data types (an extra blank to make up for the 0 start) and 13 int types for the day numbers. I designed the program to ask the user to enter the month with year they would like to create a calendar month for.
```
Give examples
```

### Testing

I had to test this project many times to try and fix numerous errors involving the leap year calculations. I also still have an issue in the code that causes the program not to run. It is an issue to do with Integer.parseInt and converting the string to int data for the user to select which month. Ex: 1 = Jan, 2= Feb, etc).

 Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Notes

Unfortunately, I was unable to successfully solve this issue within the assigned due date, and am turning in what I have, all ideally running without this parse array overloading error...
